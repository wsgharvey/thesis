\chapter{Preface}

This thesis proposal contains material from the following publications:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \bibentry{harvey2023visual} \label{harvey2023visual}
    \item \bibentry{weilbach2023graphically} \label{weilbach2023graphically}
    \item \bibentry{harvey2022flexible} \label{harvey2022flexible}
    \item \bibentry{campbell2024trans} \label{campbell2024trans}
    \item \bibentry{harvey2021conditional} \label{harvey2021conditional}
\end{enumerate}
\Cref{ch:diffusion,ch:conditional-diffusion} are written by William Harvey (WH). Some of \cref{ch:conditional-diffusion} was previously published in \cref{harvey2023visual}. The text in \cref{ch:flexible-diffusion} is previously unpublished and written by WH but the example and corresponding figure was published in \cref{weilbach2023graphically}. \Cref{ch:fdm} is based on \cref{harvey2022flexible}. \Cref{ch:tddm} is based on \cref{campbell2024trans}. \Cref{ch:cigcvae} is based on \cref{harvey2021conditional}. \Cref{ch:conclusion} contains a mixture of unpublished text written by WH and text edited from \cref{harvey2022flexible,campbell2024trans,harvey2021conditional}.

The contributions within of each author to the papers listed above are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item WH conceptualised the idea, implemented it and ran experiments. WH performed most of the writing and FW assisted with improving the presentation.
    \item Christian Weilbach (CW) conceptualised the idea. WH and CW jointly came up with the methodology, implemented the method, and ran experiments. WH and CW contributed most of the writing. FW contributed some writing and assisted with workshopping the presentation.  
    \item WH conceptualised and implemented an initial prototype. WH and Saeid Naderiparizi (SN) improved the implementation together and both ran experiments together.  SN implemented our baselines. WH, SN, and Frank Wood (FW) workshopped the presentation together. WH did the majority of the writing, while SN and FW each did some writing. WH implemented our demonstration of ``Inpainting for Bayesian Experimental Design''.
    \item WH and Christian Weilbach (CW) jointly conceptualized the method. WH implemented an initial prototype. WH and SN jointly improved the implementation and ran experiments. CW and Vaden Masrani (VM) both also assisted with running experiments. WH, SN, VM, CW and FW all helped to workshop the presentation. WH did the majority of the writing. SN and VM also contributed significantly to the writing and presentation.
    \item Andrew Campbell (AC), WH, and CW jointly conceptualised the method. AC came up with an initial formalisation of the mathematical framework. AC and WH created two implementations, for molecular and video data respectively. AC, WH, and CW iteratively ran experiments and refined the method and proposed applications. AC and Valentin De Bortoli (VDB) produced the final formalisation of the framework. Tom Rainforth (TR) and Arnaud Doucet (AD) provided advice on the method, formalisation, applications, and presentation throughout the process.

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}


This thesis will be structured as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We briefly describe the problem background and related work.
    \item We could start by motivating the problem with an application to Bayesian experimental design~\citep{harvey2022near}.
    \item Then talk about ``Conditional Image Generation by Conditioning Variational Auto-Encoders''~\citep{harvey2021conditional}.
    \item Then so dome background on diffusion models?
    \item Then talk about ``Graphically structured diffusion models''~\citep{weilbach2023graphically}.
    \item Then talk about how ``Visual Chain-of-Thought Diffusion Models''\citep{harvey2023visual} uses these insights to improve generative models in the image domain.
    \item Then talk about ``Flexible diffusion modeling of long videos''~\citep{harvey2022flexible}.
\end{itemize}

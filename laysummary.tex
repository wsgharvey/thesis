\chapter{Lay Summary}

Deep generative models, neural networks trained to generate images or videos, have improved significantly in recent years. Illustrators have started using text-to-image models, which generate an image that matches a provided caption. Anyone needing to create videos can similarly use a text-to-video model. A very useful modification of such a video model is to condition it on a user-specified set of frames, and make it generate all other video frames. ``Arbitrarily-conditional'' models like this, though, usually don't work if the videos are too long or if we don't know how many frames should be added in between any user-provided frames. We present innovations that enable these models to work in exactly these cases. We demonstrate one model that solves tasks as diverse as generating a one minute-long video given the first few seconds; given the last few seconds; or given a small number of screenshots from throughout the video.

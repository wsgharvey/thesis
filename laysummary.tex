\chapter{Lay Summary}

Deep generative models, neural networks trained to sample data such as novel images or videos, have recently shot to prominence. Text-to-image systems which generate an image that matches a provided caption have found applications as, e.g., tools for illustrators. Text-to-video systems can do the same for video. We argue that such generative models can be made ``flexible'', in the sense that a single model can be designed and trained that is applicable to far more tasks than just text-conditioning. We demonstrate flexible generative models on domains including image and video. In the video domain, our flexible generative model is capable of tasks as diverse as generating videos conditioned on the first few frames (simulating how the environment will evolve), conditioned on final frames (planning how a given state can be arrived at), or conditioned on e.g. every 10th frame (video super-resolution).

\chapter{Lay Summary}

% We deeply regret that this work is so brilliant as to be incomprehensible to a mere layperson.

We explore deep generative models, which are neural networks trained to create images and videos. They can, for example, generate pictures images or video from a text description. We demonstrate techniques to make these models more versatile, so that a user can also use them to generate an image conditioned on the known values of some of its pixels, or generate a video conditioned on one or more observed frames. As applied to video, out method is especially good at ensuring that long videos that it generates, which may be minutes to hours long, remain coherent over time. Such advancements could revolutionise how we create and edit videos and might even help in developing smart technologies for applications like autonomous driving.

% This research explores deep generative models, which are neural networks trained to create images and videos.  Imagine a computer program that can generate pictures images or video from a text description. This thesis makes these models even more versatile. For instance, if given only a part of an image, the model can intelligently fill in the rest, a process known as image inpainting. Similarly, if given only a few frames of a video, the model can fill in the remaining frames. Our method is especially good at ensuring that long videos that it generates, which may be minutes to hours long, remain coherent over time. Such advancements could revolutionize how we create and edit videos and might even help in developing smart technologies for applications like autonomous driving.
